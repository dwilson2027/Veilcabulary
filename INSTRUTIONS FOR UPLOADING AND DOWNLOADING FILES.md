1. When uploading files make sure to pull them from your local projects directory, do not export from android studio
2. Only download the file that you are working on and place it in your local project directory, if referencing another file make sure that respective changes are made
3. main .kt files are located in repository at Veilcabulary/app/src/main/java/com/example/veilcabulary
4. code is code so you don't necessarily have to code the kotlin in android studio so long as the code works
5. UI will be done using kotlin's built in jet compose so we shoould not need to touch any of the .xml files (UI will be put in the SMS.kt and Wordle.kt files along with the functionality code)
